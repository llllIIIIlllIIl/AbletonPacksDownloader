## üîß Advanced Usage

### Working Without Cookies

If you don't have `cookies.txt`, you can still use the script with existing URL files:

1. **Get URL file from someone**: Ask another user to share their `ableton-cdn-urls.txt`
2. **Use Option 5**: Choose to continue when prompted about missing cookie
3. **Manual URL management**: Use Options 1-3 to work with existing URL lists

### URL File Formats

#### ableton-cdn-urls.txt
```
https://cdn-downloads.ableton.com/livepacks/ableton/pack-name/12.0/r12345/PackName_r12345_v1.0.alp
https://cdn2-downloads.ableton.com/livepacks/ableton/other-pack/11.0/r67890/OtherPack_r67890_v2.0.alp
```

#### ableton-packs-URL-list.txt  
```
https://ableton.com/en/packs/pack-name/download/1234567/
https://ableton.com/en/packs/other-pack/download/7890123/
```

### Custom Download Locations

The script automatically creates a `downloads` directory, but you can modify the script to change the download location by editing the `target_dir` parameter in the `download_url` function.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "cookies.txt not found" Error
**Cause**: Missing authentication cookies
**Solution**: Follow the cookie setup instructions in the Quick Start section

#### "ableton-cdn-urls.txt not found" Error  
**Cause**: No URL list available
**Solutions**:
- Run Option 4 to fetch URLs (requires cookies.txt)
- Get an existing URL file from another user
- Use Option 9 for direct Ableton Live downloads

#### Downloads Fail with 403/401 Errors
**Cause**: Invalid or expired cookies
**Solutions**:
- Refresh your cookies.txt file by re-logging into Ableton
- Ensure you're logged into the correct Ableton account
- Verify the packs are actually owned by your account

#### Slow URL Checking Process
**Cause**: Large number of URLs to validate
**Solutions**:
- **Normal behavior** - the script shows progress: "Progress: X/Y URLs checked"
- Process typically takes 1-3 seconds per URL
- Consider running during off-peak hours for better performance

#### "declare: -A: invalid option" Error
**Cause**: Very old Bash version (pre-4.0)
**Solution**: The current script is compatible with Bash 3.0+ - update if you encounter this error

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check file permissions**:
   ```
   ls -la ableton-packs-downloader.sh
   chmod +x ableton-packs-downloader.sh
   ```

2. **Verify cookie format**:
   ```
   head -n 5 cookies.txt
   # Should show Netscape cookie format
   ```

3. **Test wget functionality**:
   ```
   wget --version
   curl --version
   ```

4. **Monitor downloads**:
   ```
   # In another terminal
   watch -n 1 'ls -la downloads/ | tail -10'
   ```
